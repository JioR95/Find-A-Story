# ATTENTION TO REMEMBER!!!!!!!!!

## REMEMBER TO git pull origin develop, and merging the changes into your feature branch you are working inside of before doing any coding. When submitting, submit from your feature branch first, then if it is functioning check with your conflicting to members to make sure they are not actively working on any coding before merging into develop.
